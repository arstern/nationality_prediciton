The ability to identify speakers through audio is a complex challenge; emerging technologies which rely on speech processing typically suffer when audio samples contain non-Anglican accents. As such, our goal is to predict the nationality and gender of audio samples from 31 different nationalities through training only on audio samples from individuals of English-speaking nationalities, a problem which requires zero-shot learning. Phonetic attributes are used for this task. Each language has a unique set of associated phonemes, some of which overlap with those in the English language. We explore LSTM, CNN, and FF-NNs for ex- tracting phonemes from audio samples. Predictions are based on maximal overlap in phoneme content with the unique phoneme sets for each nationality. We achieved a 92.7% test accuracy for predicting gender, and accuracies of 13.3,%, 0.97%, and 25.9% for predicting nationalities using the LSTM, CNN, and FFNN models, respectively. Overall, our work highlights the feasibility of applying zero- shot learning approaches to audio classification tasks.
